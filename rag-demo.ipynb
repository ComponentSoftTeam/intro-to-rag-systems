CONCLUSIONS \\nMigration from 1G to 4G has been  facilitated by the availabilit y of readily usable or at least known \\ntechnologies that required a limited amount of development. The migration from the operating frequency \\nof 800MHz of 1G to the 1800MHz range of 4G did not have a major  influence on signal propagation \\nproperties in air. The migration to digital technologies, introduction of new, more efficient protocols, and \\nthe extensive coverage provided by deployment of repeaters were  the main contributors to enhanced \\nperformance. However, the use of frequencies beyond 6GHz will i mpose drastic restrictions on signal \\npropagation distance. Furthermo re, the inability of signals to circumvent obstacles will progressively \\nbecome an even greater problem as higher frequencies are under consideration for future generations.'),\n",
